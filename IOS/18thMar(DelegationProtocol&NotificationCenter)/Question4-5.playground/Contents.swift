 Question 4 :
 
 For all other remote notifications, the maximum payload size is 4 KB (4096 bytes).
 
 
 Question 5
 
 Apple Push Notification service (APNs) is the centerpiece of the remote notifications feature. It is a robust, secure, and highly efficient service for app developers to propagate information to iOS (and, indirectly, watchOS), tvOS, and macOS devices.
 
 To send and receive push notifications, you must perform three main tasks:
 
 Configure your app and register it with the Apple Push Notification service (APNs).
 Send a push notification from a server to specific devices via APNs.
 Use callbacks in the app to receive and handle push notifications.
