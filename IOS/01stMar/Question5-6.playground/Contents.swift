//Question 5
/*: Segues are visual connectors between view controllers in your storyboards, shown as lines between the two controllers. They allow you to present one view controller from another, optionally using adaptive presentation so iPads behave one way while iPhones behave another.

 //Question 5
/*:
 Xib stands for xml interface builder. Xibs are the older way to perform iOS interface design. With xib any arbitrary/custom view can be designed, which a developer can attach to a view controller as needed. If we apply object oriented approach for our UIs, then it make sense to use xib and break view controller's view down into separate modules.
 Storyboards are introduced in iOS 5. When we use storyboards, our deployment target should be 5.0 or higher. With the help of storyboards we can create all the screens of an application and interconnect the screen under one interface MainStoryboard.storyboard. With storyboards we can use segues for pushing/presenting view controllers, thereby reducing the code needed for pushing/presenting.
 ViewControllers are the part of StoryBoards and we use them as a layout of the screen and they are the base part of screen.
